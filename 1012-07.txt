Hi,
Thank you for your request to download the Color FERET face image database.
We've created a Color FERET database download account for you. This is an
automated reply.

The database is in a 'tar' archive of approximately 8.5 gigabytes.

If your computer has the "wget" program, downloading is likely as easy
as executing the command:
	wget -4 -v --auth-no-challenge https://u2101207:Ov3Dj0Xr69@nigos.nist.gov/colorferet/colorferet.tar

Other computers, including Apple's macOS, may have the "curl" program,
in which case downloading is as easy as executing the command:
	curl -4 -o colorferet.tar https://u2101207:Ov3Dj0Xr69@nigos.nist.gov/colorferet/colorferet.tar

If your computer has neither program, you might be able to download the
database with a simple cut-and-paste of the URL into your browser's
Address Bar:
	https://u2101207:Ov3Dj0Xr69@nigos.nist.gov/colorferet/colorferet.tar
(Whether that works depends on your browser and how it's configured. If
it doesn't work, you'll need to search for a program for your operating
system that can download a URL.



If you wish to verify that the database was downloaded correctly,
download its corresponding MD5 checksum file, and use it to verify
the 'tar' archive, e.g.:
	wget -4 -v --auth-no-challenge https://u2101207:Ov3Dj0Xr69@nigos.nist.gov/colorferet/colorferet.tar.md5
	md5sum --check < colorferet.tar.md5

If you get an error when downloading, try from different computer, on
a different network if possible. NIST has no ability to diagnose failed
downloads.



Once downloaded, you can extract the database files the 'tar' archive
with the command:
	tar -xf colorferet.tar

The face image (including thumbnail image) files have names of the form:
	*.ppm.bz2
The '.bz2' extension indicates they've been compressed with the bzip2
program:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2
and they can be decompressed using the bunzip2 program, e.g.:
	bunzip2 *.ppm.bz2

The resulting files will have the '.ppm' extension, which indicates
they are in the 'Portable Pixmap' format:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm



The 'tar' archive contains the original (grayscale) FERET database,
under the 'colorferet/dvd2' subdirectory.

The download account will be deleted automatically after 14 days.

Thanks,
   -- The NIST Color FERET Team
